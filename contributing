# Contributing

Thanks for taking time and for considering to contribute to Steem Play. This is a very new project and we're starting from scratch (depend on development contributors) so there's tons of things you can contribute in on this project and we;re looking forward to working with you in this.

## Developing the website:

We need help developing the website. So far we have the domain https://steemplay.org and the current website is made with GoDaddy GoCentral website builder (which is a free trial and will expire in 1 month).

Help us find a new home for the website.

- Website should be a gallery type gaming website (like miniclip.com).
- For Open Source games.
- Ability to seemlessly add a game (playable/launch in new tab for download) by adding a folder in Github with the Game files or by linking a Github folder.
- Lists: Top Games, New Games, Sponsored & Featured Games.

We made a Discord Server where you can discuss things with everyone.
