Design and concept by [Deveerei](https://utopian.io/@deveerei).
Tutorials, developing, and future hosting by [Precise](https://utopian.io/@precise).
Code assistance provided by [Eastmael](https://utopian.io/@eastmael).

Road Map by [Deveerei](https://utopian.io/@deveerei):
- Launch of Oh Steem (a forked game/theme from 0hh1).
- Implementing the Design into the Code.
- Launch of browser extensions (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc).
- Launch of Oh Steem website (like 0hh1.com).
- Designing more Mini Games likes Oh Steem (probably open-sourced, forked, Steemit-themed)
- Launching a Game Gallery (Proposal to Steemit Condenser Repository/standalone extension or website) that will house all Oh Steem -like games.
- Designing and launching own games (own games/not forked).
- Study of the possibility of providing game rewards backed by Steem/SBD.
- Study of the possibility of launching a gaming SMT.

Game is Open-Source, feel free to contribute.
